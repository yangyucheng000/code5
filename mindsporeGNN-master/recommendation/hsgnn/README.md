## Heterophily-Sampling GNN(HSGNN)

- **Introduction**

Heterophily-Sampling GNN(HSGNN) is the cutting-edge work at graph with Heterophily. It's a lightweight sampling algorithm that can be easily embedded into various GNN models.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A("input (X)") --> B["Heterophily-Sampling"]
    B --> C["Various GNN models(gcn, gat...)"]
    C --> D["Output (Y)"]
    D --> F["Loss Function"]
```

- **Experimental Result**

We have achieved good results on some datasets.

| **Model**    | **Cora** | **Actor** | **Texas** |
| :----------- | :------- | --------- | --------- |
| GCN          | 87.18    | 40.18     | 76.97     |

| Ours (hsgnn) | 88.90    | 42.33     | 93.61     |

The paper of HSGNN is in the process of submission. For more details, please follow MindSpore and GraphLearning in the future

This repository contains a implementation of HSGNN based on MindSpore and GraphLearning
