## APPNP

Personalized propagation of neural predictions (PPNP), and its fast approximation (APPNP), use the relationship between graph convolutional networks (GCN) and PageRank to derive an improved propagation scheme based on personalized PageRank. It leverages a large, adjustable neighborhood for classification and can be easily combined with any neural network.

More detail about APPNP can be found in:

[Klicpera J , Bojchevski A, S GÃ¼nnemann. Predict then Propagate: Graph Neural Networks meet Personalized PageRank](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05997.pdf)

This repository contains a implementation of APPNP based on MindSpore and GraphLearning

## Datasets
